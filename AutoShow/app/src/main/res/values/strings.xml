    <string name="review">Fanboy types are always clamoring for somebody to build a Subaru that Subaru doesn’t build. And we get it. Fuji Heavy Industries is not known for its styling prowess or for its finely crafted interiors. And while Mercedes-Benz—of all companies—makes a credible WRX STI hatchback substitute in the form of the loopy-loon GLA45 AMG, you’ll pay all the money and then some. Closer to the Subie in price is the Audi S3, but like the STI, it’s available here only as a sedan. Which leaves the Volkswagen Golf R.</string>
